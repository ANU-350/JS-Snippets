  // ... then the explanation. Time to put your seat belt on.

  // In this context we only have access to the ptr (colored oop), but we
  // don't know if this refers to a stale young gen or old gen object.
  // However, by being careful with when we run young and old collections,
  // and by explicitly remapping roots we can figure this out by looking
  // at the metadata bits in the pointer.

  // *Roots (including remset)*:
  //
  // will never have double remap bit errors,
  // and will never enter this path. The reason is that there's always a
  // phase that remaps all roots between all relocation phases:
  //
  // 1) Young marking remaps the roots, before the young relocation runs
  //
  // 2) The old roots_remap phase blocks out young collections and runs just
  //    before old relocation starts

  // *Heap object fields*:
  //
  // could have double remap bit errors, and may enter this path. We are using
  // knowledge about the how *remember* bits are to narrow down the
  // possibilities.

  // Short summary:
  //
  // If both remember bits are set, when we have a double
  // remap bit error, then we know that we are dealing with
  // an old-to-old pointer.
  //
  // Otherwise, we are dealing with a young-to-any pointer,
  // and the address that contained the pointed-to object, is
  // guaranteed to have only been used by either the young gen
  // or the old gen.

  // Longer explanation:

  // Double remap bad pointers in young gen:
  //
  // After young relocation, the young gen objects were promoted to old gen,
  // and we keep track of those old-to-young pointers via the remset
  // (described above in the roots section).
  //
  // However, when young marking started, the current set of young gen objects
  // are snapshotted, and subsequent allocations end up in the next young
  // collection. Between young mark start, and young relocate start, stores
  // can happen to either the "young allocating" objects, or objects that
  // are about to become survivors. For both survivors and young-allocating
  // objects, it is true that their zpointers will be store good when
  // young marking finishes, and can not get demoted. These pointers will become
  // young remap bad after young relocate start. We don't maintain a remset
  // for the young allocating objects, so we don't have the same guarantee as
  // we have for roots (including remset). Pointers in these objects are
  // therefore therefore susceptible to become double remap bad.
  //
  // The scenario that can happen is:
  //   - Store in young allocating or future survivor happens between young mark
  //     start and young relocate start
  //   - Young relocate start makes this pointer young remap bad
  //   - It is NOT fixed in roots_remap (it is not part of the remset or roots)
  //   - Old relocate start makes this pointer also old remap bad

  // Double remap bad pointers in old gen:
  //
  // When an object is promoted, all oop*s are added to the remset. (Could
  // have either double or single remember bits at this point)
  //
  // As long as we have a remset entry for the oop*, we ensure that the pointer
  // is not double remap bad. See the roots section.
  //
  // However, at some point the GC notices that the pointer points to an old
  // object, and that there's no need for a remset entry. Because of that,
  // the young collection will not visit the pointer, and the pointer can
  // become double remap bad.
  //
  // The scenario that can happen is:
  //   - Old marking visits the object
  //   - Old relocation starts and then young relocation starts
  //      or
  //   - Young relocation starts and then old relocation starts

  // About double *remember* bits:
  //
  // Whenever we:
  // - perform a store barrier, we heal with one remember bit.
  // - mark objects in young gen, we heal with one remember bit.
  // - perform a non-store barrier outside of young gen, we heal with
  //   double remember bits.
  // - "remset forget" a pointer in an old object, we heal with double
  //   remember bits.
  //
  // Double remember bits ensures that *every* store that encounters it takes
  // a slow path.
  //
  // If we encounter a pointer that is both double remap bad *and* has double
  // remember bits, we know that it can't be young and it has to be old!
  //
  // Pointers in young objects:
  //
  // The only double remap bad young pointers are inside "young allocating"
  // objects and survivors, as described above. When such a pointer was written
  // into the young allocating memory, or marked in young gen, the pointer was
  // remap good and the store/young mark barrier healed with a single remember bit.
  // No other barrier could replace that bit, because store good is the greatest
  // barrier, and all other barriers will take the fast-path. This is true until
  // the young relocation starts.
  //
  // After the young relocation has started, the pointer became young remap
  // bad, and maybe we even started an old relocaton, and the pointer became
  // double remap bad. When the next load barrier triggers, it will self heal
  // with double remember bits, but *importantly* it will at the same time
  // heal with good remap bits.
  //
  // So, if we have entered this "double remap bad" path, and the pointer was
  // located in young gen, then it was young allocating or a survivor, and it
  // must only have one remember bit set!
  //
  // Pointers in old objects:
  //
  // When pointers become forgotten, they are tagged with double remembered
  // bits. Only way to convert the pointer into having only one remembered
  // bit, is to perform a store. When that happens, the pointer becomes both
  // remap good and remembered again, and will be handled as the roots
  // described above.

  // With the above information:
  //
  // Iff we find a double remap bad pointer with *double remember bits*,
  // then we know that it is an old-to-old pointer, and we should use the
  // forwarding table of the old collector.
  //
  // Iff we find a double remap bad pointer with a *single remember bit*,
  // then we know that it is a young-to-any pointer. We still don't know
  // if the pointed-to object is young or old.

  // Figuring out if a double remap bad pointer in young pointed at
  // young or old:
  //
  // The scenario that created a double remap bad pointer in the young
  // allocating or survivor memory is that it was written during the last
  // young marking before the old relocation started. At that point, the old
  // collector has already taken its marking snapshot, and determined what
  // pages will be marked and therefore eligible to become part of the old
  // relocation set. If the young collector relocated/freed a page
  // (address range), and that address range was then reused for an old page,
  // it won't be part of the old snapshot and it therefore won't be selected
  // for old relocation.
  //
  // Because of this, we know that the object written into the young
  // allocating page will at most belong to one of the two relocation sets,
  // and we can therefore simply check in which table we installed
  // ZForwarding.
