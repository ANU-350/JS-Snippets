since 2006 and is officially supported.

.SH STARTING THE SERVER
.PP
The following command starts the Simple Web Server:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
$\ jwebserver
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If startup is successful, the server prints a message to
\f[CB]System.out\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
listing the local address and the absolute path of the directory being
.PD 0
.P
.PD
served.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
$\ jwebserver
Binding\ to\ loopback\ by\ default.\ For\ all\ interfaces\ use\ "\-b\ 0.0.0.0"\ or\ "\-b\ ::".
Serving\ /cwd\ and\ subdirectories\ on\ 127.0.0.1\ port\ 8000
URL\ http://127.0.0.1:8000/
\f[R]
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
By default, the server runs in the foreground and binds to the loopback
.PD 0
.P
.PD
address and port 8000.
This can be changed with the \f[CB]\-b\f[R] and \f[CB]\-p\f[R] options.
??
For example, to bind the Simple Web Server to all interfaces, use:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
$\ jwebserver\ \-b\ 0.0.0.0
Serving\ /cwd\ and\ subdirectories\ on\ 0.0.0.0\ (all\ interfaces)\ port\ 8000
URL\ http://123.456.7.891:8000/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that this makes the web server accessible to all hosts on the
network.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[I]Do not do this unless you are sure the server cannot leak any
sensitive
.PD 0
.P
.PD
information.\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.PP
As another example, use the following command to run on port 9000:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
$\ jwebserver\ \-p\ 9000
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
By default, the files of the current directory are served.
A different
.PD 0
.P
.PD
directory can be specified with the \f[CB]\-d\f[R] option.
.PP
Only idempotent \f[CB]HEAD\f[R] and \f[CB]GET\f[R] requests are served.
Any other requests
.PD 0
.P
.PD
receive a \f[CB]501\ \-\ Not\ Implemented\f[R] or a
\f[CB]405\ \-\ Not\ Allowed\f[R] response.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CB]GET\f[R] requests are mapped to the directory being served, as
follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
If the requested resource is a file, its content is served.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the requested resource is a directory that contains an index file,
.PD 0
.P
.PD
the content of the index file is served.
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise, the names of all files and subdirectories of the directory
are ??
listed.
Symbolic links and hidden files are not listed or served.
.PP
MIME types are configured automatically.
For example, \f[CB]\&.html\f[R] files are
.PD 0
.P
.PD
served as \f[CB]text/html\f[R] and \f[CB]\&.java\f[R] files are served as
\f[CB]text/plain\f[R].
This can
.PD 0
.P
.PD
be customized via the \f[CB]java.net.URLConnection::getFileNameMap\f[R]
API.
.PP
By default, every request is logged on the console.
The output looks like
.PD 0
.P
.PD
this:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
127.0.0.1\ \-\ \-\ [10/Feb/2021:14:34:11\ +0000]\ "GET\ /some/subdirectory/\ HTTP/1.1"\ 200\ \-
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Logging output can be changed with the \f[CB]\-o\f[R] option.
The default setting is
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CB]info\f[R].
The \f[CB]verbose\f[R] setting additionally includes the request and
response ??
headers as well as the absolute path of the requested resource.
.SH STOPPING THE SERVER
.PP
Once started successfully, the server runs until it is stopped.
On Unix
.PD 0
.P
.PD
platforms, the server can be stopped by sending it a \f[CB]SIGINT\f[R]
signal
.PD 0
.P
.PD
(\f[CB]Ctrl+C\f[R] in a terminal window).
.SH HELP OPTION
.PP
The \f[CB]\-h\f[R] option displays a help message listing usage and
options of
.PD 0
.P
.PD
the Simple Web Server.
