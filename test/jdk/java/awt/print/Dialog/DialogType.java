            This test assumes and requires that you have a printer installed.
            It verifies that the dialogs behave properly when using new API
            to optionally select a native dialog where one is present.
            Two dialogs are shown in succession.
            The test passes as long as no exceptions are thrown, *AND*,
            if running on Windows only, the first dialog is a native windows
            control which differs in appearance from the second dialog.
            Note: You can either press 'ESCAPE' button or click on the 'Cancel'
            to close print dialog.
